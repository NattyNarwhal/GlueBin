# GlueBin

This is a pastebin service, powered by C#/Nancy/MongoDB.

## TODO

* [ ] File uploading?
* [ ] Authentication. Classes are set up, but they don't do anything, and the routes aren't set up to require auth.
* [ ] Paste management. This depends on authentication.
* [ ] Syntax highlighting. Will need to update the model, run post-processing in the route, then show the rendering.
* [ ] Searching. Can be pretty simple.
